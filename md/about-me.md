My name is Tallen Pelissero. I am a High School student at Great Lakes Christian High School. I enjoy programming in many different programming languages, and continue to learn every day. I am proficient in high and low level programming - from python to C.

Many of my friends call me "Linux", due to my obsession with the operating system shown by my habit of compiling custom kernels.

I like to consider myself a perfectionist. If something isn't working exactly how it should, I'll invest my time into ensuring that the issue is entirely resolved.

Here is a list of programming languages that I know well :

- Rust
- C
- C#
- C++
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- Shell
- JavaScript

Here are some languages that I am interested in learning :

- Java/Kotlin
- Go
- Assembly
